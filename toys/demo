Why Torch is a nice choice
 - figure
 - lua underneath, torch on top
 - tensor demo, in place operations, chaining
 - nn as general purpose computation
 - can implement neural nets tersely (rnn code snipit)
Torch and GPU
 - figure
 - gpu code
 - gpu demo
Toy model
 - MLP
 - RNN
 - LSTM
Tips
 - checking gradients
 - compare implementations

Checking gradients:
th model-1_layer-variable.lua -hidden 5 -mode check
